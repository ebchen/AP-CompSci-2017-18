Maze Lab

# Purpose

"In this lab you will use the power of a stack and a queue to explore and find your way through a maze. The purpose of this lab is to:

* Have you implement a stack and a queue,

* Build a simple linked list of nodes,

* Use your stack and queue to solve a maze,

* Explore the differences between the two solution strategies."

* Apply software team development best practices

# Requirements

* Complete the [CSCI 151 - Stacks and Queues Simply A-Maze-ing! lab](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~rhoyle/16s-cs151/lab03/index.html) from Oberlin.

* Changes from the lab as written for Oberlin:

    * The code is in the MazeApp folder in your current repository. You can skip all the steps under "starting point code"

    * You will use IntelliJ and not Eclipse.

    * Answer questions 2, 4, and 5 in Part 5 in the README file.

* You will work with a partner on this summative lab and demonstrate your understanding of using GitHub as a team

    * You and your partner must create and use branches for your development as specified in the daily milestones

    * You and your partner must issue pull requests to incorporate changes in your branch into master

* Include a reflection in your repository in which you reflect on you and your partners implementation of the GitHub best practices for team development. What did you or your partner do well? What do you or your partner need to improve next time? What would you do differently next time?

* This lab is recorded as two labs in the gradebook. One score is based on satisfying the requirements for the Maze lab. The other score is based on demonstrating GitHub best practices.

# Daily Milestones (will be checked daily by instructor)

1. (**Teammate A & B**) implement Square class skeleton in square branch; implement Square class unit test; run test; implement Square class; run test; pull into master (**pair programming**)

2. (**Teammate A**) implement Maze class skeleton in mazeSkeleton branch; pull into master
(**Teammate B**) implement Maze unit test in mazeTest branch; run test; pull into master

(**Teammate A**) implement Maze class in maze branch

(**Teammate A & B**) run Maze unit test; debug Maze class; pull into master (**pair programming**)

3. (**Teammate A**) implement MyStack and MyStackTest in stack branch; pull into master
(**Teammate B**) implement MyQueue and MyQueueTest in queue branch; pull into master

4. (**Teammate A & B**) implement MazeSolver in solver branch (**pair programming**)

5. (**Teammate A**) implement MazeSolverStack in stackSolver branch (branched from solver and not master)
(**Teammate B**) MazeSolverQueue in queueSolver branch (branched from solver and not master)

6. tie up loose ends; pull both branches into solver; pull into master

# Extensions

* Try the bonus mazes.

* Add more awesome.
