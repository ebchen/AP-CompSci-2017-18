It was Thanksgiving. A firefighter was with his family. They saw that it was snowing outside. The firefighter ate a
large meal. He was so full. He wanted to go for a walk. The firefighter walked outside. His children went with him.
They made a snowman sitting on a seesaw. His little boy and girl worked hard on the snowman.
They gave the
snowman a strawberry mouth. They made him a cardboard hat. They shined a flashlight on the snowman. They
wanted everyone to see the snowman. The firefighter smiled. He wished that the snowman would last forever. He
knew that it could not. The firefighter was thankful to be with his family.
